# MERN Stack web app project: New in Town.

With my web app **_New in Town_** you, as a user, can collect and save all new & neccessary places to find after moving to a new city. New doctors to see, new caf√©s, restaurants and bars you get recommendations for and want to go out to, new places for trips in and around the city, new haircutters, new spa and wellness spots, and so on and so forth.

I developed the web app as my _first MERN Stack project_ during my professional education as a **_Fullstack Web Developer_** at Code Academy Berlin. I've implemented the CRUD operations using React and MongoDB as database.

**Please watch out: This app is work in progress** and designed mobile first. Have a look at the deployed work-in-progress-state here on [Vercel](https://new-in-town.vercel.app/)
