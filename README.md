# MERN Stack web app project: New in Town.

With my web app **_New in Town_** a registered user can collect and save all new & neccessary places to find after moving to a new city. New doctors to see, new caf√©s, restaurants and bars you get recommendations for and want to go out to, new places for trips in & around the city, new haircutters, new spa & wellness spots, and so on and so forth.

I developed the web app as my _first MERN Stack project_ during my professional education as a **_Fullstack Web Developer_** at Code Academy Berlin. I've implemented the **_CRUD operations_** using **React** & **MongoDB** as database.

**Please note: This app is still a work in progress** and designed mobile first. Next, I'm working on a global improvement of the UX/UI and full functionality of all pages and categories. Have a look at the deployed work-in-progress-version here on [Vercel](https://new-in-town.vercel.app/)
